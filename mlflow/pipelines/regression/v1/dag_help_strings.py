PIPELINE_YAML = "pipeline.yaml is the main configuration file for the pipeline. It defines attributes for each step of the regression pipeline, such as the dataset to use (defined in the 'data' section corresponding to the 'ingest' step) and the metrics to compute during model training & evaluation (defined in the 'metrics' section, which is used by the 'train' and 'evaluate' steps)."
